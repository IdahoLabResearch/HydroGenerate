# Example Files <br>

Multiple example files are included to illustrate **HydroGenerate (HG)** functionality. This file describes the content included in each file. Select the example file that best matches your project. These files serve as examples and do not intend to describe all existing functionality.


1. **BasicMode.ipynb** describes how to use HG in basic mode, i.e., to calculate head, power, or flow, based on the other two. 
2. **EconomicCalculation.ipynb** presents functionality to compute projects initial capital cost (ICC) and Operation and Maintenance (O&M).
3. **DiversionMode.ipynb** describes how to estimate hydropower potential for run-of-river facilities. Most HG's functionalty are accessed in Diversion Mode. 
4. **Hydrokinetics.ipynb** describes how to use HG to compute hydrokinetic potential.
