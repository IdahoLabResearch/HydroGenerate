# HydroGenerate: Hydropower Potential Estimation

HydroGenerate (HG) is an open-source python library that has the capability of estimating hydropower generation for different scenarios and technologies. There are three types of hydropower facilities: 1) impoundment, 2) diversion, 3) pumped storage ​(DOE, 2023)​. In addition, hydrokinetic technologies offer the possibility to generate electricity from the movement of water, without a dam or a diversion by using the kinetic energy of the flowing water. HG can assist impoundment, diversion, and hydrokinetic preliminary assessments.
